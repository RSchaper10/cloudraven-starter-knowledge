Page Summary

outlined_flag

This guide explains how the Federated Credentials Management API (FedCM) changes your web application, focusing on sign-in flows without third-party cookies.

With FedCM enabled, the browser manages user settings and prompts, contacting Identity Providers only after explicit user consent.

Automatic sign-in behavior with FedCM has been updated, requiring reconfirmation only when third-party cookies are restricted.

Migrating to FedCM involves adding specific boolean flags for One Tap and Button initialization and removing methods related to display moment notifications and detailed skip reasons.

When using One Tap or Button in cross-origin iframes with FedCM, the

allow="identity-credentials-get"

attribute must be added to all parent iframes, and customizing prompt position is not supported.

This guide helps you understand the changes to your web application introduced by the

Federated Credentials Management API

(FedCM).

When FedCM is enabled the browser displays user prompts and no third-party cookies are used.

Overview

FedCM enables more private sign-in flows without requiring the use of third-party cookies. The browser controls user settings, displays user prompts, and only contacts an Identity Provider such as Google after explicit user consent is given.

For most websites, migration occurs seamlessly through backward compatible updates to the Google Identity Services JavaScript library.

Updates on Auto Sign-in feature

Federated Credential Management (FedCM) Beta

for Google Identity Services was launched in August 2023. Many developers tested the API and have provided valuable feedback.

One response Google heard from developers is about the FedCM automatic sign-in flow user gesture requirement. For improved privacy, Chrome requires users to reconfirm that they want to sign in to the website with Google Account in each Chrome instance even if the user approved the website prior to the FedCM rollout. This one-time reconfirmation is achieved through a single click of the One Tap prompt or

Button flow

with FedCM to demonstrate user intent to sign-in. This change may cause an initial disruption in automatic sign-in conversion rates for some websites.

Recently in M121, Chrome made a

change

to the FedCM automatic sign-in flow UX. The reconfirmation is only required when third-party cookies are restricted. This means:

FedCM automatic sign-in does not require reconfirmation for returning users. If users reconfirm with FedCM UI, this reconfirmation will count toward the user gesture requirement for the post-3PCD era.

FedCM automatic sign-in will check the reconfirmation status when the third-party cookies are manually restricted by users today, or by default in future Chrome.

With this change, we recommend all automatic sign-in developers migrate to FedCM as soon as possible, to reduce disruption to automatic sign-in conversion rates.

For the automatic sign-in flow, GIS JavaScript won't trigger FedCM on an older Chrome (before M121), even if your website chooses to opt-in FedCM.

User journey differences

The One Tap experiences using FedCM and without FedCM are similar only with minor differences.

Single-session new user

Using FedCM, One Tap shows the top-level domain name instead of application name.

Using FedCM

Without FedCM

Single-session returning user (with automatic sign-in disabled)

Using FedCM, One Tap shows the top-level domain name instead of application name.

Using FedCM

Without FedCM

Single-session returning user (with automatic sign-in enabled)

Using FedCM, users can click

X

to cancel the automatic sign-in within 5 seconds instead of clicking the

Cancel

button.

Using FedCM

Without FedCM

Multiple-session

Using FedCM, One Tap shows the top-level domain name instead of application name.

Using FedCM

Without FedCM

See Sign in with Google button

page

for the key user journeys for FedCM Button flow.

Before you begin

Check that your browser settings and version

supports

the FedCM API, updating to the latest version is recommended.

FedCM API is available in Chrome 117 or later.

The

Third-party sign-in

setting is enabled in Chrome. The setting only affects One Tap and has no impact on the FedCM button flow.

If your Chrome browser version is 119 or earlier, open

chrome://flags

and enable the experimental

FedCmWithoutThirdPartyCookies

feature. This step isn't needed with Chrome browser version 120 or later.

Migrate your web app

Follow these steps to enable FedCM, evaluate potential migration impact, and if needed to make changes to your existing web application:

1.

Add

a boolean flag to enable FedCM for

Button

when initializing using: (Optional)

HTML, set the

data-use_fedcm_for_button

attribute to

true

to enable FedCM Button flow. With FedCM Button flow enabled only, you can also set

data-use_fedcm_for_button

attribute to

true

to enable the new

auto select

feature.

JavaScript, set

use_fedcm_for_button

to

true

in the

IdConfiguration

object to enable FedCM Button flow. With FedCM Button flow enabled only, you can also set

button_auto_select

attribute to

true

to enable the new

auto select

feature.

2.

Remove

use of

isDisplayMoment()

,

isDisplayed()

,

isNotDisplayed()

, and

getNotDisplayedReason()

methods for One Tap in your code.

To improve user privacy, the

google.accounts.id.prompt

callback no longer returns any display moment notification in the

PromptMomentNotication

object. Remove any code that depends on the display moment related methods. They are

isDisplayMoment()

,

isDisplayed()

,

isNotDisplayed()

, and

getNotDisplayedReason()

methods.

3.

Remove

use of

getSkippedReason()

method for One Tap in your code.

While the skip moment,

isSkippedMoment()

, would still be called from the

google.accounts.id.prompt

callback in the

PromptMomentNotication

object, detailed reason wouldn't be provided. Remove any code that depends on the

getSkippedReason()

method from your code.

Note that the dismissed moment notification,

isDismissedMoment()

, and the related detailed reason method,

getDismissedReason()

, are unchanged when FedCM is enabled.

4.

Remove

position

style attributes from

data-prompt_parent_id

and

intermediate_iframes

for One Tap.

The browser controls the size and position of user prompts, custom positions for One Tap on Desktop are not supported.

5.

Update

page layout if needed for One Tap.

The browser controls the size and position of user prompts. Depending upon the layout of individual pages, some content might be overlaid as custom positions for One Tap on Desktop are not supported in any way such as

style attribute

,

data-prompt_parent_id

,

intermediate_iframes

, customized iframe, and other creative ways.

Change page layout to improve the user experience when important information is obscured. Don't build your UX around the One Tap prompt even if you assume it is in the default position. Because the FedCM API is browser-mediated, different browser vendors may place the position of the prompt slightly differently.

6.

Add

allow="identity-credentials-get"

attribute to parent frame if your web app calls One Tap or Button API from cross-origin iframes.

An iframe is considered as cross-origin if its

origin

is not exactly the same as the parent origin. For Example:

Different domains:

https://example1.com

and

https://example2.com

Different top-level domains:

https://example.uk

and

https://example.jp

Subdomains:

https://example.com

and

https://login.example.com

When using One Tap in a cross-origin iframe, users may encounter a confusing experience. The One Tap prompt displays the

top-level

domain's name, not the iframe's, as a security measure to prevent credential harvesting. However, the ID tokens are issued to the iframe's origin. Review this

GitHub issue

for more details.

Because this discrepancy can be misleading, only using One Tap in cross-origin but

same-site

iframes is a

supported

method. For example, a page on the top-level domain

https://www.example.com

using iframe to embeds a page with One Tap on

https://login.example.com

. The One Tap prompt will display "Sign in to example.com with google.com".

All other cases like different domains are

unsupported

. Instead, consider alternative integration methods like:

Implementing the

Sign in with Google button

without FedCM enabled.

Implementing One Tap on the top-level domain

Utilizing the

Google OAuth 2.0 endpoints

for more customized integration.

If you're embedding a third-party site within an iframe and can't modify its One Tap implementation, you can prevent the One Tap prompt from appearing within the iframe. To do this, remove the

allow="identity-credentials-get"

attribute from the iframe tag in the parent frame. This will suppress the prompt, and you can then guide your users to the embedded site's sign-in page directly.

When One Tap or Button API is called from cross-origin iframes, you must add

allow="identity-credentials-get"

attribute in every parent frame

iframe

tag:

<iframe src="

https://your.cross-origin/onetap.page

" allow="identity-credentials-get"></iframe>

If your app utilizes an iframe that contains another iframe, you must ensure that the attribute is added to every iframe, including all sub-iframes.

For example, consider the following scenario:

The top document (

https://www.example.uk

) contains an iframe named "Iframe A", which embeds a page (

https://logins.example.com

).

This embedded page (

https://logins.example.com

) also contains an iframe named "Iframe B," which further embeds a page (

https://onetap.example2.com

) that hosts One Tap or Button.

To ensure that One Tap or Button can be displayed properly, the attribute must be added to both Iframe A and Iframe B tags.

Prepare

for inquiries on the One Tap prompt or Button not displayed. Other sites with different origins may embed your pages that host One Tap within their iframes. You may receive increased amount of support tickets related to One Tap or Button not showing up from end-users or other site owners. While the updates can only be made by the site owners on their pages, you can do the following to mitigate the impact:

Update your developer documentation to include how to set up the iframe properly to call your site. You can link to this page in your documentation.

Update your developer FAQs page if applicable.

Let your support team know this upcoming change and prepare for the response to the inquiry ahead of time.

Proactively contact impacted partners, customers, or site owners for a smooth FedCM transition.

7.

Add

these

directives

to your Content Security Policy (CSP).

This step is optional as not all websites choose to define a CSP.

If CSP is not used in your website, no changes are needed.

If your CSP works for the current One Tap or Button and you don't use

connect-src

,

frame-src

,

script-src

,

style-src

, or

default-src

no changes are needed.

Otherwise, follow this

guide

to set up your CSP. Without proper CSP setup, the FedCM One Tap or Button wouldn't be displayed on the site.

8.

Remove

Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) support for sign-in.

User sign-in support for AMP is an optional feature of GIS your web app may have implemented. If this is the case,

Delete

any references to the:

amp-onetap-google

custom element, and

<script async custom-element="amp-onetap-google" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-onetap-google-0.1.js"></script>

Consider redirecting sign-in requests from AMP to your website's HTML sign-in flow. Note that the related

Intermediate Iframe Support API

is unaffected.

Test and verify your migration

After making necessary changes based on the preceding steps, you can verify the migration is successful.

Confirm your browser

supports

FedCM and you have an existing Google Account session.

Navigate to the One Tap or Button page(s) in your application.

Confirm that the One Tap prompt or Button is displayed and safely overlays underlying content.

Confirm a correct credential returns to your endpoint or callback method when signing in your application using One Tap or Button.

If automatic sign in is enabled, verify that cancelling works and a correct credential returns to your endpoint or callback method.

One Tap cooldown period

Clicking One Tap

close

on the top-right corner closes the prompt and enters the cooldown period which suppresses the One Tap prompt from displaying temporarily. In Chrome, if you want to have One Tap prompt shown again before the cooldown period ends, you can reset the cooldown status by clicking the lock icon in the address bar and clicking the

Reset Permission

button.

Automatic sign in quiet period

When testing

automatic sign in

One Tap using FedCM, it has a 10 minute quiet period between every automatic sign-in attempt. The quiet period can't be reset. You would have to wait for 10 minutes or use different Google Account for testing in order to trigger automatic sign in again.
