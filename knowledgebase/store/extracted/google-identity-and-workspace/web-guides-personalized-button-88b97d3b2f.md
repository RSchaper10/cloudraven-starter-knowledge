Page Summary

outlined_flag

The Sign in with Google button's user experience varies based on Google session status and whether the user is new or returning to your website.

A personalized button displays profile information for approved Google sessions with corresponding accounts on your website, indicating session status before clicking.

The Federated Credential Manager (FedCM) API allows the personalized button to be displayed even when third-party cookies are blocked, improving returning user experience and enabling auto-select for signed-in returning users.

User journeys are outlined for different scenarios, including new and returning users with or without active Google sessions, with variations depending on whether FedCM is enabled.

Family Link accounts have additional steps requiring parental approval during the sign-in process, though this is not currently supported with the FedCM button.

This page describes the user experience (UX) of the Sign in with Google button.

Button rendering

A personalized button displays profile information for the first Google session that approves your website. An approved Google session has a corresponding account on your website who has signed in using Sign In With Google before.

If a personalized button is displayed, the user knows the following:

There's at least one active Google session.

There's a corresponding account on your website.

A personalized button gives users a quick indication of the session status, both on Google's side and on your website, before they click the button. This is especially helpful to end users who visit your website only occasionally. They may forget whether an account has been created or not, and in which way. A personalized button reminds them that Sign In With Google has been used before. Thus, it helps to prevent unnecessary duplicate account creation on your website.

To indicate the session status, the personalized button is displayed in the following ways:

One session:

There's only one session on Google's side. That session approves the client, and there's a corresponding account on your website.

Multiple sessions:

There are multiple sessions on Google's side. Those sessions approve the client. The approval is indicated by the list arrow next to the displayed account. At least one session has a corresponding account on your website.

No session:

There's no session on Google's side, or none of the sessions have approved the client yet.

The personalized button is automatically displayed when the session status is suitable, unless your button settings don't allow the personalized button to be displayed. The personalized button is not displayed if:

The

data-type

attribute is

icon

.

The

data-size

attribute is set to

medium

or

small

.

The

data-width

attribute is set to a number smaller than 200px.

Third-party cookie is blocked, and

FedCM version

of button is not enabled.

The name or email address is ellipsized when they are too long to be displayed inside the button.

Federated Credential Manager (FedCM)

Privacy Sandbox for the Web

introduces significant changes to Google Identity Services and user sign in. It impacts the Sign in with Google personalized button. While sign-in flow is unaffected with the button, with 3rd-party cookies blocked, your returning users wouldn't see the personalized button.

With

Federated Credentials Management

API (FedCM) button flow, users would be able to see the personalized Sign in with Google button on your site. By default, FedCM is disabled, but you can enable FedCM by changing one attribute (

HTML

/

JavaScript

). The benefits of the FedCM button include:

Improved Returning User Experience

: The returning user sign-in process is streamlined because users can recognize their existing accounts. This improved recognition is proven to lead to a higher click-through rate (CTR). Furthermore, unlike the button flow without having FedCM enabled, the FedCM button flow supports the

automatic select

feature - returning users with an active Google session will be automatically signed in after clicking the button, bypassing the Account Chooser prompt.

Enhanced Feature Integration

: We've integrated One Tap and Auto Sign-in functionalities, enabling all Federated Credential Management (FedCM) Sign-in with Google features from a single Relying Party (RP) to work in concert. The user gestures in the FedCM button flow will be recorded and honored by Chrome to fulfill the one-time reconfirmation for One Tap auto sign-in flow. This ensures a seamless experience across all features.

Key user journeys

The user journeys vary based on the following statuses.

Session status on Google websites. The following terms are used to indicate different Google session status when the user journey starts.

Has-Google-session

: There is at least one active session on Google websites.

No-Google-session

: There is no active session on Google websites.

Whether the selected Google Account has approved your website when the user journey starts. The following terms are used to indicate different approval status.

New user

: The selected account hasn't approved your website.

Returning user

: The selected account has approved your website before.

for more information.

Properly set up the Content Security Policy (CSP) of your site. See
