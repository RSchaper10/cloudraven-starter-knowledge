Page Summary

outlined_flag

The Sign in with Google JavaScript API is used to display the Sign In With Google button or One Tap prompt on webpages.

The

google.accounts.id.initialize

method is used to configure the Sign In With Google client and should generally be called only once.

The

google.accounts.id.prompt

method displays the One Tap prompt or browser built-in credential manager after initialization, and a momentListener can be used to track UI status.

When a credential response is received, it includes a base64-encoded JWT ID token in the

credential

field and information on how the user signed in in the

select_by

field.

Other methods like

renderButton

to display the Sign In with Google button,

disableAutoSelect

to manage user sign-out status, and

revoke

to withdraw user consent are also available.

This reference page describes the Sign in with Google JavaScript API, used to display the Sign In With Google button or One Tap prompt on web pages.

Method: google.accounts.id.initialize

The

google.accounts.id.initialize

method initializes the Sign In With Google client based on the configuration object. See the following code example of the method:

google

.

accounts

.

id

.

initialize

(

IdConfiguration

)

The following code example implements the

google.accounts.id.initialize

method with an

onload

function:

<

script

>

window

.

onload

=

function

()

{

google

.

accounts

.

id

.

initialize

({

client_id

:

'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'

,

callback

:

handleCredentialResponse

});

google

.

accounts

.

id

.

prompt

();

};

<

/script

>

The

google.accounts.id.initialize

method creates a Sign In With Google client instance that can be implicitly used by all modules in the same web page.

You only need to call the

google.accounts.id.initialize

method once even if you use multiple modules (like One Tap, Personalized button, revocation, etc.) in the same web page.

If you do call the

google.accounts.id.initialize

method multiple times, only the configurations in the last call is remembered and used.

You actually reset the configurations whenever you call the

google.accounts.id.initialize

method, and all subsequent methods in the same web page immediately use the new configurations.

Data type: IdConfiguration

The following table lists the fields and descriptions of the

IdConfiguration

data type:

The following table lists the supported value types and their descriptions.

Value Types

string

"https://example.com"

string array

An array of domain URIs.

["https://news.example.com", "https://local.example.com"]

Wildcard prefixes are also supported. For example,

"https://*.example.com"

matches

example.com

and its subdomains at all levels (e.g

news.example.com

,

login.news.example.com

). Things to keep in mind when using wildcards:

Pattern strings cannot be composed of only a wildcard and a top level domain. For example

https://

.com

and

https://

.co.uk

are invalid as

"https://

.example.com"

matches

example.com

and all its subdomains. Use a comma separated list to represent two different domains. For example,

"https://example1.com,https://

.example2.com"

matches the domains

example1.com

,

example2.com

and the subdomains of

example2.com

Wildcard domains must begin with a secure https:// scheme, so

"*.example.com"

is considered invalid.

If the value of

allowed_parent_origin

field is invalid, the One Tap initialization of the intermediate iframe mode would fail and stop.

intermediate_iframe_close_callback

Overrides the default intermediate iframe behavior when users manually close One Tap by tapping on the 'X' button in the One Tap UI. The default behavior is to remove the intermediate iframe from the DOM immediately.

The

intermediate_iframe_close_callback

field takes effect only in intermediate iframe mode. And it has impact only to the intermediate iframe, instead of the One Tap iframe. The One Tap UI is removed before the callback is invoked.

Type

Required

Example

Type

Required

Example

boolean

Optional

login_hint

If your application knows in advance which user should be signed-in, it can provide a login hint to Google. When successful, account selection is skipped. Accepted values are: an email address or an ID token

sub

field.

Example

boolean

Optional

button_auto_select: true

Method: google.accounts.id.prompt

The

google.accounts.id.prompt

method displays the One Tap prompt or the browser built-in credential manager after the

initialize()

method is invoked. See the following code example of the method:

google

.

accounts

.

id

.

prompt

(

/**

@type{(function(!PromptMomentNotification):void)=} */

momentListener

)

Normally, the

prompt()

method is called on page load. Due to the session status and user settings on the Google side, the One Tap prompt UI might not be displayed. To get notified on the UI status for different moments, pass a function to receive UI status notifications.

Notifications are fired on the following moments:

Display moment:

This occurs after the

prompt()

method is called. The notification contains a boolean value to indicate whether the UI is displayed or not.

Skipped moment:

This occurs when the One Tap prompt is closed by an auto cancel, a manual cancel, or when Google fails to issue a credential, such as when the selected session has signed out of Google.

In these cases, we recommend that you continue on to the next identity providers, if there are any.

Dismissed moment:

This occurs when Google successfully retrieves a credential or a user wants to stop the credential retrieval flow. For example, when the user begins to input their username and password in your login dialog, you can call the

google.accounts.id.cancel()

method to close the One Tap prompt and trigger a dismissed moment.

The following code example implements the skipped moment:

<

script

>

window

.

onload

=

function

()

{

google

.

accounts

.

id

.

initialize

(...);

}

});

};

The

sub

field is a globally unique identifier for the Google Account.

Only

use

sub

field as identifier for the user as it is unique among all Google Accounts and never reused.

Using the

email

,

email_verified

and

hd

fields you can determine if Google hosts and is authoritative for an email address. In cases where Google is authoritative the user is confirmed to be the legitimate account owner.

Cases where Google is authoritative:

email

has a

@gmail.com

suffix, this is a Gmail Account.

email_verified

is true and

hd

is set, this is a Google Workspace account.

Users may register for Google Accounts without using Gmail or Google Workspace. When

email

does not contain a

@gmail.com

suffix and

hd

is absent Google is not authoritative and password or other challenge methods are recommended to verify the user.

email_verfied

can also be true as Google initially verified the user when the Google Account was created, however ownership of the third party email account may have since changed.

The

exp

field shows the expiration time for you to

verify the token on your server side

. It is one hour for the ID token obtained from Sign In With Google. You need to

verify the token

before the expiration time.

Don't use

exp

for session management

. An expired ID token does

not

mean the user is signed out. Your app is responsible for session management of your users.

select_by

The following table lists the possible values for the

select_by

field. The type of button used along with the session and consent state are used to set the value,

The user pressed either the One Tap or Sign In With Google button or used the touchless Automatic sign-in process.

An existing session was found, or the user selected and signed-in to a Google Account to establish a new session.

Prior to sharing ID token credentials with your app the user either

pressed the Confirm button to grant their consent to share credentials, or

had previously granted consent and used Select an Account to choose a Google Account.
