Configure an application to expose a web API

Feedback

Summarize this article for me

In this how-to guide, you'll register a web API with the Microsoft identity platform and expose it to client apps by adding a scope. By registering your web API and exposing it through scopes, assigning an owner and app role, you can provide permissions-based access to its resources to authorized users and client apps that access your API.

Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,

create an account for free

.

An application registered in the

Microsoft Entra admin center

. If you don't have one,

register an application

now.

Register the web API

Access to APIs requires configuration of access scopes and roles. If you want to expose your resource application web APIs to client applications, configure access scopes and roles for the API. If you want a client application to access a web API, configure permissions to access the API in the app registration. To provide scoped access to the resources in your web API, you first need to register the API with the Microsoft identity platform.

Sign in to the

Microsoft Entra admin center

as at least a

Cloud Application Administrator

.

If you have access to multiple tenants, use the

Settings

icon

in the top menu to switch to the tenant containing the app registration from the

Directories + subscriptions

menu.

Perform the steps in

register an application

and skip the

Redirect URI (optional)

section. You don't need to configure a redirect URI for a web API since no user is logged in interactively.

Assign application owner

In your app registration, under

Manage

, select

Owners

, and

Add owners

.

In the new window, find and select the owner(s) that you want to assign to the application. Selected owners appear in the right panel. Once done, confirm with

Select

. The app owner(s) will now appear in the owner's list.

Note

Ensure that an owner is assigned to both the API application and the application you want to add permissions to, otherwise the API will not be listed when requesting API permissions.

Assign app role

In your app registration, under

Manage

, select

App roles

, and

Create app role

.

Next, specify the app role's attributes in the

Create app role

pane. For this walk-through, you can use the example values or specify your own.

Field

Description

Example

Display name

The name of your app role

Employee Records

Allowed member types

Specifies whether the app role can be assigned to users/groups and/or applications

Applications

Value

The value displayed in the "roles" claim of a token

Employee.Records

Description

A more detailed description of the app role

Applications have access to employee records

Select the checkbox to enable the app role, and then select

Apply

.

Add a scope

With the web API registered, assigned an app role and owner, you can add scopes to the API's code so it can provide granular permission to consumers.

The code in a client application requests permission to perform operations defined by your web API by passing an access token along with its requests to the protected resource (the web API). Your web API then performs the requested operation only if the access token it receives contains the scopes required for the operation.

Add a scope requiring admin and user consent

First, follow these steps to create an example scope named

Employees.Read.All

:

Select

Expose an API

.

At the top of the page, select

Add

next to

Application ID URI

. This defaults to

api://<application-client-id>

. The App ID URI acts as the prefix for the scopes you'll reference in your API's code, and it must be globally unique. Select

Save

.

Select

Add a scope

:

Next, specify the scope's attributes in the

Add a scope

pane. For this walk-through, you can use the example values or specify your own.

Field

Description

Example

Scope name

The name of your scope. A common scope naming convention is

resource.operation.constraint

.

Employees.Read.All

Who can consent

Whether this scope can be consented to by users or if admin consent is required.

Admins only

should be used for higher-privileged permissions.

Admins and users

Admin consent display name

A short description of the scope's purpose that only admins will see.

Read-only access to Employee records

Admin consent description

A more detailed description of the permission granted by the scope that only admins will see.

Allow the application to have read-only access to all Employee data.

User consent display name

A short description of the scope's purpose. Shown to users only if you set

Who can consent

to

Admins and users

.

Read-only access to your Employee records

User consent description

A more detailed description of the permission granted by the scope. Shown to users only if you set

Who can consent

to

Admins and users

.

Allow the application to have read-only access to your Employee data.

State

Whether the scope is enabled or disabled.

Enabled

Select

Add scope

.

(Optional) To suppress prompting for consent by users of your app to the scopes you've defined, you can

pre-authorize

the client application to access your web API. Pre-authorize

only

those client applications you trust since your users won't have the opportunity to decline consent.

Under

Authorized client applications

, select

Add a client application

.

Enter the

Application (client) ID

of the client application you want to pre-authorize. For example, that of a web application you've previously registered.

Under

Authorized scopes

, select the scopes for which you want to suppress consent prompting, then select

Add application

.

If you followed this optional step, the client app is now a pre-authorized client app (PCA), and users won't be prompted for their consent when signing in to it.

Add a scope requiring admin consent

Next, add another example scope named

Employees.Write.All

that only admins can consent to. Scopes that require admin consent are typically used for providing access to higher-privileged operations, and often by client applications that run as backend services or daemons that don't sign in a user interactively.

To add the

Employees.Write.All

example scope, follow the steps in the

Add a scope

section and specify these values in the

Add a scope

pane. Select

Add scope

when you're done:

Field

Example value

Scope name

Employees.Write.All

Who can consent

Admins only

Admin consent display name

Write access to Employee records

Admin consent description

Allow the application to have write access to all Employee data.

User consent display name

None (leave empty)

User consent description

None (leave empty)

State

Enabled

Verify the exposed scopes

If you have successfully added both example scopes described in the previous sections, they'll appear in the

Expose an API

pane of your web API's app registration, similar to the following image:

The scope's full string is the concatenation of your web API's

Application ID URI

and the scope's

Scope name

. For example, if your web API's application ID URI is

https://contoso.com/api

and the scope name is

Employees.Read.All

, the full scope is:

https://contoso.com/api/Employees.Read.All

Using the exposed scopes

In the next article in this series, you configure a client app's registration with access to your web API and the scopes you defined by following the steps in this article.

Once a client app registration is granted permission to access your web API, the client can be issued an OAuth 2.0 access token by the identity platform. When the client calls the web API, it presents an access token whose scope (

scp

) claim is set to the permissions you've specified in the client's app registration.

You can expose additional scopes later as necessary. Consider that your web API can expose multiple scopes associated with several operations. Your resource can control access to the web API at runtime by evaluating the scope (

scp

) claims in the OAuth 2.0 access token it receives.

Next step

Now that you've exposed your web API by configuring its scopes, configure your client app's registration with permission to access the scopes.

Configure an app registration for web API access
