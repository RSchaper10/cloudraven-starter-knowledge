Summarize this article for me

Applies to

:

External tenants (

learn more

)

In this quickstart you learn how to run an iOS sample application that demonstrates sign-up, sign in, sign out, and reset password scenarios using Microsoft Entra External ID.

Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one,

Create an account for free

This Azure account must have permissions to manage applications. Any of the following Microsoft Entra roles include the required permissions:

Application Administrator

Application Developer

An external tenant. If you don't have one,

create a new external tenant

in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

If you haven't already done so,

Register an application in the Microsoft Entra admin center

. Make sure to:

Record the

Application (client) ID

and

Directory (tenant) ID

for later use.

Grant admin consent

to the application.

If you haven't already done so,

Create a user flow in the Microsoft Entra admin center

Associate your app registration with the user flow

Xcode

Enable public client and native authentication flows

To specify that this app is a public client and can use native authentication, enable public client and native authentication flows:

From the app registrations page, select the app registration for which you want to enable public client and native authentication flows.

Under

Manage

, select

Authentication

.

Under

Advanced settings

, allow public client flows:

For

Enable the following mobile and desktop flows

select

Yes

.

For

Enable native authentication

, select

Yes

.

Select

Save

button.

Clone sample iOS mobile application

Open Terminal and navigate to a directory where you want to keep the code.

Clone the iOS mobile application from GitHub by running the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-native-auth-ios-sample.git

Navigate to the directory where the repo was cloned:

cd ms-identity-ciam-native-auth-ios-sample

Configure the sample iOS mobile application

In Xcode, open

NativeAuthSampleApp.xcodeproj

project.

Open

NativeAuthSampleApp/Configuration.swift

file.

Find the placeholder:

Enter_the_Application_Id_Here

and replace it with the

Application (client) ID

of the app you registered earlier.

Enter_the_Tenant_Subdomain_Here

and replace it with the Directory (tenant) subdomain. For example, if your tenant primary domain is

contoso.onmicrosoft.com

, use contoso. If you don't have your tenant subdomain, learn how to

read your tenant details

.

Note

Remember to select a scheme to build and destination where you run the built products. Each scheme contains a list of real or simulated devices that represent the available destinations.

Run and test sample iOS mobile application

To build and run your code, select

Run

from the

Product

menu in Xcode. After a successful build, Xcode will launch the sample app in the Simulator.

This guide tests

Email one-time-passcode

usage. Enter a valid email address, select

Sign Up

, and launch the submit code screen:

After you enter your email address on the previous screen, the application will send a verification code to it. Once you submit the received code, the application takes you back to the previous screen and automatically signs you in.

Other scenarios that this sample supports

The sample app supports the following flows:

Email + password

covers sign-in or sign-up flows with an email with password.

Email + password sign-up with user attributes

covers sign-up with email and password, and submitting user attributes.

Password reset

covers self-service password reset (SSPR).

Access Protected API

covers call a protected API after the user successfully signs up or signs in and acquires an access token.

Fallback to web browser

covers the use the browser-based authentication as a fallback mechanism when the user can't complete authentication through native authentication for whatever reason.

Test email with password flow

In this section, you test email with password flow, with its variants such as, email with password sign-up with user attributes and SSPR:

Use the steps in

create a user flow

to create a new user flow, but this time select

Email with password

as your authentication method. You need to configure

Country/Region

and

City

as the user attributes. Alternatively, you can modify the existing user flow to use

Email with password

(Select

External Identities

>

User flows

>

SignInSignUpSample

>

Identity providers

>

Email with password

>

Save

).

Use the steps in

associate the application with the new user flow

to add an app to your new user flow.

Run the sample app, then select the ellipsis menu (

...

) to open more options.

Select the scenario you want to test, such as

Email + password

or

Email + password sign-up with user attributes

or

Password reset

, then follow the prompts. To test

Password reset

, you need to first sign up a user, and

enable email one-time passcode

for all users in your tenant.

Test call a protected API flow

Use the steps in

Call a protected web API in a sample iOS mobile app by using native authentication

to call a protected web API from a sample Android mobile app.

Enable sign-in with an alias or username

You can allow users who sign in with an email address and password to also sign in with a username and password. The username also called an alternate sign-in identifier, can be a customer ID, account number, or another identifier that you choose to use as a username.

You can assign usernames to the user account manually via the Microsoft Entra admin center or automate it in your app via the Microsoft Graph API.

Use the steps in

Sign in with an alias or username

article to allow your users to sign-in using a username in your application:

Enable username in sign-in

.

Create users with username in the admin center

or

update existing users to by adding a username

. Alternatively, you can also

automate user creation and updating in your app by using the Microsoft Graph API

.
