Supported account types

Feedback

Summarize this article for me

This article explains what account types (sometimes called

audiences

) are supported in the Microsoft identity platform applications.

Account types in the public cloud

In the Microsoft Azure public cloud, most types of apps can sign in users with any audience:

If you're writing a line-of-business (LOB) application, you can sign in users in your own organization. Such an application is sometimes called

single-tenant

.

If you're an independent software vendor (ISV), you can write an application that signs in users:

In any organization. Such an application is called a

multitenant

web application. You'll sometimes read that it signs in users with their work or school accounts.

With their work or school or personal Microsoft accounts.

With only personal Microsoft accounts.

If you're writing a business-to-consumer application, you can also sign in users with their social identities, by using Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C). Effective May 1, 2025, Azure AD B2C will no longer be available to purchase for new customers. To learn more, please see

Is Azure AD B2C still available to purchase?

in our FAQ.

Account type support in authentication flows

Some account types can't be used with certain authentication flows. For instance, in desktop, Universal Windows Platform (UWP), or daemon applications:

Daemon applications can be used only with Microsoft Entra organizations. It doesn't make sense to try to use daemon applications to manipulate Microsoft personal accounts. The admin consent will never be granted.

You can use the integrated Windows authentication flow only with work or school accounts (in your organization or any organization). Integrated Windows authentication works with domain accounts, and it requires the machines to be domain-joined or Microsoft Entra joined. This flow doesn't make sense for personal Microsoft accounts.

The

Resource Owner Password Credentials grant

(username/password) can't be used with personal Microsoft accounts. Personal Microsoft accounts require that the user consents to accessing personal resources at each sign-in session. That's why this behavior isn't compatible with non-interactive flows.

Account types in national clouds

Apps can also sign in users in

national clouds

. However, Microsoft personal accounts aren't supported in these clouds. That's why the supported account types are reduced, for these clouds, to your organization (single tenant) or any organizations (multitenant applications).
