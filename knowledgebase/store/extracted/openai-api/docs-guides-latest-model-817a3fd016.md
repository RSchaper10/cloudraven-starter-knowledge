GPT-5.4

is our most capable frontier model yet, delivering higher-quality outputs with fewer iterations across ChatGPT, the API, and Codex. It helps people and teams analyze complex information, build production software, and automate multi-step workflows.

In practice,

gpt-5.4

is the default model for both broad general-purpose work and most coding tasks. Start there when you want one model that can move between software engineering, reasoning, writing, and tool use in the same workflow.

This guide covers key features of the GPT-5 model family and how to get the most out of GPT-5.4.

Key improvements

Compared with the previous GPT-5.2 model, GPT-5.4 shows improvements in:

Coding, document understanding, tool use, and instruction following

Image perception and multimodal tasks

Long-running task execution and multi-step agent workflows

Token efficiency and end-to-end performance on tool-heavy workloads

Agentic web search and multi-source synthesis, especially for hard-to-locate information

Document-heavy and spreadsheet-heavy business workflows in customer service, analytics, and finance

GPT-5.4 brings the coding capabilities of GPT-5.3-Codex to our flagship frontier model. Developers can generate production-quality code, build polished front-end UI, follow repo-specific patterns, and handle multi-file changes with fewer retries. It also has a strong out-of-the-box coding personality, so teams spend less time on prompt tuning.

For agentic workloads, GPT-5.4 reduces end-to-end time across multi-step trajectories and often completes tasks with fewer tokens and tool calls. This makes agents more responsive and lowers the cost of operating complex workflows at scale in the API and Codex.

New features in GPT-5.4

Like earlier GPT-5 models, GPT-5.4 supports custom tools, parameters to control verbosity and reasoning, and an allowed tools list. GPT-5.4 also introduces several capabilities that make it easier to build powerful agent systems, operate over larger bodies of information, and run more reliable automated workflows:

tool_search

in the API:

GPT-5.4 improves tool search for larger tool ecosystems by using deferred tool loading. This makes tools searchable, loads only the relevant definitions, reduces token usage, and improves tool selection accuracy in real deployments. Learn more in the

tool search guide

.

1M token context window:

GPT-5.4 supports up to a 1M token context window, making it easier to analyze entire codebases, long document collections, or extended agent trajectories in a single request. Read more in the

1M context window

section.

Built-in computer use:

GPT-5.4 is the first mainline model with built-in computer-use capabilities, enabling agents to interact directly with software to complete, verify, and fix tasks in a build-run-verify-fix loop. Learn more in the

computer use guide

.

Native compaction support:

GPT-5.4 is the first mainline model trained to support compaction, enabling longer agent trajectories while preserving key context.

Meet the models

In general,

gpt-5.4

is the default model for your most important work across both general-purpose tasks and coding. It replaces the previous

gpt-5.2

model in the API, and

gpt-5.3-codex

in Codex. The model powering ChatGPT is

gpt-5-chat-latest

. For more difficult problems,

gpt-5.4-pro

uses more compute to think longer and provide consistently better answers.

For smaller, faster variants, start with

gpt-5.4-mini

or

gpt-5.4-nano

.

To help you pick the model that best fits your use case, consider these tradeoffs:

Variant

Best for

gpt-5.4

General-purpose work, including complex reasoning, broad world knowledge, and code-heavy or multi-step agentic tasks

gpt-5.4-pro

Tough problems that may take longer to solve and need deeper reasoning

gpt-5.4-mini

High-volume coding, computer use, and agent workflows that still need strong reasoning

gpt-5.4-nano

Simple high-throughput tasks where speed and cost matter most

Lower reasoning effort

The

reasoning.effort

parameter controls how many reasoning tokens the model generates before producing a response. Earlier reasoning models like o3 supported only

low

,

medium

, and

high

:

low

favored speed and fewer tokens, while

high

favored more thorough reasoning.

Starting with GPT-5.2, the lowest setting is

none

to provide lower-latency interactions. This is the default setting in GPT-5.2 and newer models. If you need more thinking, slowly increase to

medium

and experiment with results.

With reasoning effort set to

none

, prompting is important. To improve the model’s reasoning quality, even with the default settings, encourage it to “think” or outline its steps before answering.

}

)

print

(response)

Verbosity

Verbosity determines how many output tokens are generated. Lowering the number of tokens reduces overall latency. While the model’s reasoning approach stays mostly the same, the model finds ways to answer more concisely—which can either improve or diminish answer quality, depending on your use case. Here are some scenarios for both ends of the verbosity spectrum:

High verbosity:

Use when you need the model to provide thorough explanations of documents or perform extensive code refactoring.

Low verbosity:

Best for situations where you want concise answers or simple code generation, such as SQL queries.

GPT-5 made this option configurable as one of

high

,

medium

, or

low

. With GPT-5.4, verbosity remains configurable and defaults to

medium

.

When generating code with GPT-5.4,

medium

and

high

verbosity levels yield longer, more structured code with inline explanations, while

low

verbosity produces shorter, more concise code with minimal commentary.

(response)

You can still steer verbosity through prompting after setting it to

low

in the API. The verbosity parameter defines a general token range at the system prompt level, but the actual output is flexible to both developer and user prompts within that range.

1M context window

1M token context window was introduced with GPT-5.4, making it easier to analyze entire codebases, long document collections, or extended agent trajectories in a single request.

We have separate standard pricing for requests under 272K and over 272K tokens, available in the

pricing docs

. If you use

priority processing

, any prompt above 272K tokens is automatically processed at standard rates.

Long context pricing stacks with other pricing modifiers such as data residency and batch.

We have different rate limits for requests under 272K tokens and over 272K tokens; this is available on the

GPT-5.4 model page

.

Using tools with GPT-5.4

GPT-5.4 has been post-trained on specific tools. See the

tools docs

for more specific guidance.

Computer use tool

Computer use lets GPT-5.4 operate software through the user interface by inspecting screenshots and returning structured actions for your harness to execute. It is a good fit for browser or desktop workflows where a person could complete the task through the UI, such as navigating a site, filling out forms, or validating that a change actually worked.

Use it in an isolated browser or VM, and keep a human in the loop for high-impact actions. The full guide covers the built-in Responses API loop, custom harness patterns, and code-execution-based setups.

Computer use guide

Learn how to run the built-in computer tool safely and integrate it with your own harness.

Tool search tool

Tool search lets GPT-5.4 defer large tool surfaces until runtime so the model loads only the definitions it needs. This is most useful when you have many functions, namespaces, or MCP tools and want to reduce token usage, preserve cache performance, and improve latency without exposing every schema up front.

Use hosted tool search when the candidate tools are already known at request time, or client-executed tool search when your application needs to decide what to load dynamically. The full guide also covers best practices for namespaces, MCP servers, and deferred loading.

Tool search guide

Learn how to defer tool definitions and load the right subset at runtime.

Custom tools

When the GPT-5 model family launched, we introduced a new capability called custom tools, which lets models send any raw text as tool call input but still constrain outputs if desired. This tool behavior remains true in GPT-5.4.

Function calling guide

Learn about custom tools in the function calling guide.

Freeform inputs

Define your tool with

type: custom

to enable models to send plaintext inputs directly to your tools, rather than being limited to structured JSON. The model can send any raw text—code, SQL queries, shell commands, configuration files, or long-form prose—directly to your tool.

"type"

:

"custom"

,

"name"

:

"code_exec"

,

"description"

:

"Executes arbitrary python code"

,

}

Constraining outputs

GPT-5.4 supports context-free grammars (CFGs) for custom tools, letting you provide a Lark grammar to constrain outputs to a specific syntax or DSL. Attaching a CFG (e.g., a SQL or DSL grammar) ensures the assistant’s text matches your grammar.

This enables precise, constrained tool calls or structured responses and lets you enforce strict syntactic or domain-specific formats directly in GPT-5.4’s function calling, improving control and reliability for complex or constrained domains.

Best practices for custom tools

Write concise, explicit tool descriptions

. The model chooses what to send based on your description; state clearly if you want it to always call the tool.

Validate outputs on the server side

. Freeform strings are powerful but require safeguards against injection or unsafe commands.

Allowed tools

The

allowed_tools

parameter under

tool_choice

lets you pass N tool definitions but restrict the model to only M (< N) of them. List your full toolkit in

tools

, and then use an

allowed_tools

block to name the subset and specify a mode—either

auto

(the model may pick any of those) or

required

(the model must invoke one).

Function calling guide

Learn about the allowed tools option in the function calling guide.

By separating all possible tools from the subset that can be used

now

, you gain greater safety, predictability, and improved prompt caching. You also avoid brittle prompt engineering, such as hard-coded call order. GPT-5.4 dynamically invokes or requires specific functions mid-conversation while reducing the risk of unintended tool usage over long contexts.

For a more detailed overview of all of these new features, see the

prompt guidance for GPT-5.4

.

Preambles

Preambles are brief, user-visible explanations that GPT-5.4 generates before invoking any tool or function, outlining its intent or plan (e.g., “why I’m calling this tool”). They appear after the chain-of-thought and before the actual tool call, providing transparency into the model’s reasoning and enhancing debuggability, user confidence, and fine-grained steerability.

By letting GPT-5.4 “think out loud” before each tool call, preambles boost tool-calling accuracy (and overall task success) without bloating reasoning overhead. To enable preambles, add a system or developer instruction—for example: “Before you call a tool, explain why you are calling it.” GPT-5.4 prepends a concise rationale to each specified tool call. The model may also output multiple messages between tool calls, which can enhance the interaction experience—particularly for minimal reasoning or latency-sensitive use cases.

For more on using preambles, see the

GPT-5 prompting cookbook

.

Migration guidance

GPT-5.4 is our best model yet, and it works best with the Responses API, which supports passing chain of thought (CoT) between turns to improve performance. Read below to migrate from your current model or API.

Migrating from other models to GPT-5.4

Use the

OpenAI Docs skill

when migrating existing prompts or workflows to GPT-5.4. It’s available in our public skills repository and the Codex desktop app.

While the model should be close to a drop-in replacement for GPT-5.2, there are a few key changes to call out. See

Prompt guidance for GPT-5.4

for specific updates to make in your prompts.

Using GPT-5 models with the Responses API provides improved intelligence because of the API’s design. The Responses API can pass the previous turn’s CoT to the model. This leads to fewer generated reasoning tokens, higher cache hit rates, and less latency. To learn more, see an

in-depth guide

on the benefits of the Responses API.

When migrating to GPT-5.4 from an older OpenAI model, start by experimenting with reasoning levels and prompting strategies. Based on our testing, we recommend using our

prompt optimizer

—which automatically updates your prompts for GPT-5.4 based on our best practices—and following this model-specific guidance:

gpt-5.2

:

gpt-5.4

with default settings is meant to be a drop-in replacement.

o3

:

gpt-5.4

with

medium

or

high

reasoning. Start with

medium

reasoning with prompt tuning, then increase to

high

if you aren’t getting the results you want.

gpt-4.1

:

gpt-5.4

with

none

reasoning. Start with

none

and tune your prompts; increase if you need better performance.

o4-mini or gpt-4.1-mini

:

gpt-5.4-mini

with prompt tuning is a great replacement.

gpt-4.1-nano

:

gpt-5.4-nano

with prompt tuning is a great replacement.

New

phase

parameter

For long-running or tool-heavy GPT-5.4 flows in the Responses API, use the assistant message

phase

field to avoid early stopping and other misbehavior.

phase

is optional at the API level, but we highly recommend using it. Use

phase: "commentary"

for intermediate assistant updates (such as preambles before tool calls) and

phase: "final_answer"

for the completed answer. Do not add

phase

to user messages.

If you use

previous_response_id

, that is usually the simplest path because prior assistant state is preserved. If you replay assistant history manually, preserve each original

phase

value.

Missing or dropped

phase

can cause preambles to be treated as final answers in those workflows. For additional guidance and examples, see the

GPT-5.4 prompting guide

.

GPT-5.4 parameter compatibility

The following parameters are

only supported

when using GPT-5.4 with reasoning effort set to

none

:

temperature

top_p

logprobs

Requests to GPT-5.4 or GPT-5.2 with any other reasoning effort setting, or to older GPT-5 models (e.g.,

gpt-5

,

gpt-5-mini

,

gpt-5-nano

) that include these fields will raise an error.

To achieve similar results with reasoning effort set higher, or with another GPT-5 family model, try these alternative parameters:

Reasoning depth:

reasoning: { effort: "none" | "low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh" }

Output verbosity:

text: { verbosity: "low" | "medium" | "high" }

Output length:

max_output_tokens

Migrating from Chat Completions to Responses API

The biggest difference, and main reason to migrate from Chat Completions to the Responses API for GPT-5.4, is support for passing chain of thought (CoT) between turns. See a full

comparison of the APIs

.

Passing CoT exists only in the Responses API, and we’ve seen improved intelligence, fewer generated reasoning tokens, higher cache hit rates, and lower latency as a result of doing so. Most other parameters remain at parity, though the formatting is different. Here’s how new parameters are handled differently between Chat Completions and the Responses API:

GPT-5.4 is a reasoning model

Reasoning models like GPT-5.4 break problems down step by step, producing an internal chain of thought that encodes their reasoning. To maximize performance, pass these reasoning items back to the model: this avoids re-reasoning and keeps interactions closer to the model’s training distribution. In multi-turn conversations, passing a

previous_response_id

automatically makes earlier reasoning items available. This is especially important when using tools—for example, when a function call requires an extra round trip. In these cases, either include them with

previous_response_id

or add them directly to

input

.

reasoning guide

FAQ

How are these models integrated into ChatGPT?

In ChatGPT, there are three models: GPT‑5 Instant, GPT‑5 Thinking, and GPT‑5 Pro. Based on the user’s question, a routing layer selects the best model to use. Users can also invoke reasoning directly through the ChatGPT UI.

All three ChatGPT models (Instant, Thinking, and Pro) have a new knowledge cutoff of August 2025. For users, this means GPT-5.4 starts with a more current understanding of the world, so answers are more accurate and useful, with more relevant examples and context, even before turning to web search.

Will these models be supported in Codex?

Yes,

gpt-5.4

is the newest model that powers Codex and Codex CLI. You can also use this as a standalone model for building agentic coding applications.

How does GPT-5.4 compare to GPT-5.3-Codex?

GPT-5.3-Codex

is specifically designed for use in coding environments such as Codex. GPT-5.4 is designed for both general-purpose work and coding, making it the better default when your workflow spans software engineering plus planning, writing, or other business tasks. GPT-5.3-Codex is only available in the Responses API and supports

low

,

medium

,

high

, and

xhigh

reasoning effort settings along with function calling, structured outputs, streaming, and prompt caching. It doesn’t support all GPT-5.4 parameters or API surfaces.

What is the deprecation plan for previous models?

Any model deprecations will be posted on our

deprecations page

. We’ll send advanced notice of any model deprecations.

What are the reasoning efforts supported?

GPT 5 supports minimal, low, medium (default), and high.

GPT 5.2 supports none (default), low, medium, and high.

GPT 5.4 supports none (default), low, medium, high, and xhigh.
